# ChiStreetStory [https://KaraAJC.github.io/chi-street-story](https://KaraAJC.github.io/chi-street-story)

ChiStreetStory is a site built from a hackathon during the [Nerd Immersion]() event, put on by the [Nerdery]().

## Goals

- use Chicago Data Portal
- Find a street by name
- get a link(or content) on the history of that name
- highlight the street on a map

## Stretch Goals

- have a pronounciation of the street name "in chicagoan"
  - (maybe allow for folks to input a pronounciation)
- add honorary street names
- have a way for folks to request a street to be changed
- have a way to determine the cost of the name street change
  - only cost of street sign replacements, total cost would include maps, etc. [source](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/The-312/September-2013/Chicago-Street-Names/)
